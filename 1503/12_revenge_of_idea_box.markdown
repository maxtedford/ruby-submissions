Nice use of js.erb, really clean code - skinny controller, clean view, good use of partials, really like the way you handled the thumbs up/thumbs down with a get/remote: true ... so clever.

Tests have excellent coverage of edge cases for model tests. Tests are clear and easy to understand. Feature tests could cover more user interface.
JS code is clean and easy to read. Callbacks could be extracted into separate functions. Responsibilities of each function are clear and intuitive.
Excellent code quality, code is very clear, concise, and clean across the board. I like your use of rails helper methods and gems. App is very easy for users to navigate and the interface is very intuitive.

* Really awesome use of blur event to cover your ass.

* Good restful practices by updating the quality with the same action as the
other attributes

* A state machine may have been overkill for a project of this scope

Liked that you used FactoryGirl for tests.
Liked that you did the form validation with the alert
Liked that you specified the title and body for the keyup filter

Would have been nice to figure out respond_with rather than respond_to
Index action creates an @ideas variable AND an @idea variable
